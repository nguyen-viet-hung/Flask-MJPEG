# Flask-MJPEG

This repo demonstrates how to create a simple MJPEG web server with VideoCapture
The idea was based on the [py-mjpeg](https://github.com/janakj/py-mjpeg)

* Prepare environments
```
pip install flask opencv-python Pillow
```

* Run the web server
```
python mjpeg.py
```

Now the web server is running on 0.0.0.0:8080, you can use the web browser surf on localhost:8080 to see.
